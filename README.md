# GradientDescentNetwork
Disclaimer: this repo is for my own use. It may or may not be readable by others. I'm implementing a simple neural net that learns by gradient descent and back propagation. My goal is to do this without following a tutorial or looking anything up, so it'll probably be trash, but help me learn. Enjoy.
